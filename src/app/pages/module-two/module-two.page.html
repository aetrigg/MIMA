                      <li>

            <p>An action plan comprised of process goals provides clear “targets” upon which to focus your attention. It will set your targets for <i>what</i> you do, <i>how</i> you do it, and your <i>mental</i> and <i>emotional state</i> while performing each task.</p>

          <li>
            <p>In performance situations such as surgery, where a person is liable to encounter unexpected challenges beyond one’s control, it becomes increasingly important to optimize those performance factors that you can control. You may not be able to control events; but you can control how you respond to those events.</p>

          line in the list consists of several synonyms; you may select only one word on the same line.
          Circle the words that you select. If you don’t find a word describing an emotion that is important to you, you may add your own word at the end of the list.</p>
