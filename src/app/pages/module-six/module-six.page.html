              <p>
                Refocusing refers to developing explicit strategies to redirect attention to the essential
                elements for situations in which attention goes “off target”.

              <p>
                By developing refocusing strategies, a person can prepare to deal with any situation that
                might impair performance.

                Research and training with elite athletes and military personnel affirm that what happens to
                you is not as important as how you react to what happens to you.

                  Effective refocusing strategies require using the top down brain to initially develop a
                  strategy, and then the bottom up brain to practice and automate the process to the point that it
                  becomes a routine.

          <h3>Exercise: Developing refocusing plans (“If-Then”)</h3>  
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                In the “IF” column of the exercise below, list every situation or circumstance that has bothered
                you or interfered with your surgical or FLS training performance in the past. Underneath these
                past situations (in the same column), list any situations that you might encounter in the future
                that have the potential for impairing your performance. Draw upon any information you have
                heard or seen where colleagues have been distracted. If you have any concerns about performing
                a surgical procedure, this is the time to claim them and name them.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Next, you want to plan a strategy for each situation that you have identified. This is a series of
                “If-Then” scenarios that you can do to navigate back on target and to your Ideal Performance
                State. Your strategy should include both specific physical actions and mental techniques. The
                physical actions typically are very task and situation specific. The mental techniques are
                typically one or more of the 3 “adjusting skills” that we have discussed: centering with rapid
                relaxation, attention/thought management, and imagery. Whenever possible, integrate triggers
                and cues with your plan.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                This is your “Plan A”. Next, repeat the process to detail a Plan B or fallback option in the event
                that Plan A is not fully effective. Again, integrate triggers and cues. It is important to custom
                tailor your strategies to your language, habits, strengths and weaknesses. Typically, the more detailed the strategy, the more effective it will be. Devise both a Plan A and Plan B for each
                potential situation you have identified.

                Once you’ve identified your refocusing strategies (both Plan A and Plan B), practice those
                strategies to the point of automation where a distracting event will automatically trigger the
                associated refocusing routine (think back to the “foreign language tip” discussed in Module
                4.)

                  After you have successfully practiced the situation and your refocusing routine with imagery,
                  look for simulated situations to practice the routine. After successfully mastering the process
                  in simulated situations, and aiming to be truly proficient, seek out opportunities to practice
                  the process in real life situations.

                  “Inverted U”- At low levels of anxiety or tension, performance tends to be relatively low, as
                  a person may feel tired, flat, bored, or not bring sufficient intensity to the performance
                  situation. As anxiety and tension increase, performance also increases, up to a point where
                  there is a balance between optimal anxiety and optimal performance. If tension and anxiety
                  increase beyond this optimal level, performance begins to gradually decline. This model has
                  strong face validity for people familiar with performance, and has been widely accepted for
                  several decades.

                  “Catastrophe Model”- This model concurs with the initial aspects of the “Inverted U”
                  hypothesis and that as anxiety increases beyond the optimal level there is initially a gradual
                  decline. However, if anxiety continues to increase, there is a certain point where the decline
                  is no longer gradual, but plummets. This is the point of catastrophe where an individual is
                  flooded with fear-induced adrenaline, and cognitively flooded with thoughts of fear and
                  disaster. This is what is referred to as an “emotional hijack”.

                  Dr. Ken Ravizza describes the optimal level of performance as the “Green Zone”. The
                  performer is fully engaged, focused, and in their Ideal Performance State. Refocusing
                  strategies are designed to help a person navigate from circumstances where tension is less
                  than optimal - the Yellow Zone – back to the Green Zone. Ideally, your performances will
                  be in the Green Zone, and you will rapidly navigate any temporary fluctuations into the
                  Yellow Zone back to your optimal performance level. However, if you ever do experience a
                  catastrophe where you fall in the Red Zone, you want to know how to get back on track for
                  performance.

                <b>Reactivate gradually.</b> Experienced skiers know that after taking a serious fall, it is best to center
                oneself, and gradually resume the descent, focusing upon regaining a sense of balance and
                rhythm prior to picking up speed and attempting to reenter their “Green Zone”. The same is true
                in surgery: reactivate gradually by slowing down, and focus upon reestablishing a sense of
                balance and rhythm.
