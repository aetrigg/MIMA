            While a minor amount of stress may help mobilize an individual’s attention and energy to execute a
            task, an excessive amount of stress can clearly have a significantly negative impact on performance
            and increase the chance of performance errors. In the operating room, surgeons frequently experience
            small but continuous amounts of stress, which accumulate and can lead to more significant
            performance detriments. There are also occasions when surgeons’ stress levels become excessive, so
            they are susceptible to a variety of performance-related impediments.

              <b>Reflection:</b> Think back to any past performance situation when you felt overwhelmed due to
              stress. How did you perform? What were you focused on?
              <br>
              <b>Consider the complex nature of different surgical procedures. </b>There is always inherent difficulty
              with performing these procedures due to their intricate technical aspects, but what are additional
              sources of stress (e.g., patient-related complications) that may have a detrimental effect on
              performance?

            Surgery requires not only acquiring knowledge, skills and abilities; but also being able to perform
            those skills and abilities on demand.

            Reduce the variability of your performance so that your average is consistently excellent. You can
            accomplish this by increasing those things under your control that improve your average, and develop
            strategies to address those things not under your control that reduce your average.

              <b>Reflection:</b>Take a moment to think about a specific time that you have experienced your best
              performance where you had a high level of proficiency and had to perform on demand. It may
              have been a sporting event, an experience from the performing arts, public speaking or a class
              presentation – any situation where you had to perform on demand, and felt as though you
              performed at the top of your ability. It is important to choose a specific memory, so if you have
              several examples, select just one. Briefly describe this specific experience when you performed
              your best. For that specific event, what was the difference that made your performance
              exceptional?

            In psychology, “mental skills” refers to “the principles and techniques addressing the psychological
            aspects of human performance to help people consistently perform in the upper range of their abilities
            and more thoroughly enjoy the performance process.”

        </li>

            Successful performance requires both physical and mental skills. Mental skills are involved in
            developing and mastering knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA’s) related to performance, as well as
            aiding in the execution of KSA’s, consistently and reliably. Mental skills optimize the mind-body
            connection during performance by managing attention, thoughts and emotions. These skills help
            enhance performance over an established baseline, not simply remediate a performance decline or
            problem situation

            <i>
              <b>Reflection:</b> What do you think we mean by “mind-body connection”? Have you experienced this
              before?  
            </i> 
          </p>

      <h3>0.2 Mental Skills Curriculum</h3>  
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The goal for this curriculum is to integrate mental skills as part of your surgical simulation training
              and to help you develop strategies to address those factors not under your control that can cause stress
              and impair performance. 
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In addition to viewing the seven modules in the curriculum (via smart phone, computer or other
              electronic device) and completing exercises in your workbook, you will discuss these concepts with a
              mental skills trainer who will customize these techniques to your unique skills and strengths. You
              will also get the opportunity to immediately apply these mental skills as you practice the
              “Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery” tasks.

                <b>Reflection:</b> Consider how you might already be using mental skills to enhance your performance
                (in any endeavor). What techniques do you use? What situations do you use them in? How do
                they benefit your performance? In what ways could you improve the effectiveness of these
                techniques for you?
